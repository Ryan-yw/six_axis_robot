CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "aris" with any of
  the following names:

    arisConfig.cmake
    aris-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "aris" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "aris_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "aris"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
